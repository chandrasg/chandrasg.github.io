I am an Assistant Professor (Research) in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on building predictive models for and uncovering insight into health outcomes and psychological states of individuals and communities.

I develop computational models utilizing large-scale user-generated text, image, and mobile sensor data to answer questions pertaining to geospatial, cross-cultural, and temporal aspects of human behavior. My recent work investigates the manifestation of conditions such as loneliness, ADHD, stress, and depression on social media platforms and the role of heterogeneity in the digital behaviors of individuals across cultures. The resulting [insights](https://chandrasg.github.io/publications/) have the potential to supplement clinical diagnoses, facilitate early and personalized interventions, and improve treatments.

My work has been covered by the American Psychological Association, WIRED, Canadian Broadcasting Company, The Atlantic, US News, and other [venues](https://chandrasg.github.io/media/).
